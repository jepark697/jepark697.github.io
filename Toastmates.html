  <p><strong>Introduction</strong></br></br>
 For a Cognitive Design studio course my team of 6, Toastmates, decided to tackle the issue of dividing labor between housemates and keeping them accountable. The process involved 40+ interviews interviews, personas, a giant affinity diagram, storyboarding, prototyping, 5+ validation interviews, and iterating.
 </p>
    <p><strong>Process</strong></br></br>

In order to tackle this large project, we decided to interview 7-10 people each. We aimed to choose from a variety of different people including primary, secondary, and tertiary stakeholders. Some interviewees included those that live in dormitories, on-campus apartments, and off-campus apartments, a pair of roommates, graduate students, and even a landlord. </p>

<p>We tried to frame the interviews to better understand the interviewee’s housing situation. From there we talked to them about whether or not their household was having problems. Households that weren’t having issues helped us to understand the deeper meaning behind what creates peace. Households that were having issues helped us to understand the underlying themes that cause problems.</p>

<p>After interviewing, we moved onto creating personas. This allowed us to identify 6 types of roommates and really empathize with our users. One persona I made can be seen below.</p>

</br>

<p>After making personas, it was time to make an affinity diagram. We started off by writing down significant nuggets from our interviews onto post its. Then, we each went around and discussed them. This communication helped us to identify some preliminary themes. Then, as a group, we started grouping the post-its together.</p>

</br>

<p>After doing this, we discussed the themes that emerged. Specifically, what factors helped roommates get along. Conversely, what were the underlying reasons that created problems for roommates. Then, we silently wrote solutions to each problem that emerged. Afterwards, we had an open discussion about what we wrote and started to ideate solutions.</p>

<p>What we came to realize is that our solution needed to have accountability but also forgiveness. Based on our interviews, if there was no accountability, some roommates started to slack in chore doing. Conversely, tension was created in households when a roommate would hold a mistake over another roommate’s head. We also came to the conclusion that this was not a one size fits all scenario. Some households had lax rules and had no issues. Other households established a list of rules that all went wayside because there was no accountability or bad communication. As a result, we realized our solution needed to serve as a tool to allow roommates to communicate more effectively.</p>

<p>Thus, we decided to create a Roommate Solution Manual. We aimed at including different methods that the user could customize. They could choose to use all or only a  few of the tools provided. </p>

<p>Additionally, we wanted different tools to tackle different issues at different stages. Some tools could be used before choosing a roommate such a roommate survey. Other tools could be used in the preliminary stages such as an “I value” form that allows roommates to write down what they value then discuss it together. Still, other tools could be used later such as satisfaction cards to rate a roommate’s satisfaction with the current living situation or a chore chart to keep track when chores were done.</p> 

<p>We sketched these ideas to really understand how they would work within a group. Two sketches I did can be seen below.</p>

</br>

<p>After doing this, we decided to each create storyboards to really understand how these solutions would be used.</p>

</br>

<p>Then, it was time to prototype. We each created different versions of the tools. This was mostly done either digitally using Google Documents, or physically with paper objects. My version of the chore chart and the satisfaction cards can be seen below.</p>

</br>

<p>Although we thought our solution seemed fairly reasonable, we decided to test this out. We held 5+ validation interviews for 2 reasons. The first was to simply see which methods might be used by our users. The second was to evaluate if this would be a good idea. Because our group was biased towards thinking our solution would work, we wanted fresh eyes to let us know how they would use it and what would or would not work.</p>

<p>From there, we iterated. We decided which tools to keep and which to modify. This was a heavily involved process where all the members discussed the pros and cons of each decision. We didn’t want our solution to be redundant, but we also didn’t want to leave something out.</p> 

<p>We did make some interesting choices. Some were more straightforward such as deciding to include a “what to do when section” to help users decide what to do when a problem occurs. This was done because from our interviews, some newer roommates did not know how to tackle an emerging problem.</p>

<p>Other decisions were more complex. For example, we decided to keep two versions of cards in our final prototype. This was because one of the cards was based on satisfaction while another set of cards was based on accountability in hypothetical situations to establish ground rules. Because they served different purposes, both were included.</p>

<p>In the end, after 10 grueling weeks, we were able to successfully create a build your own adventure type Roommate Solution Manual.</p>

<p><strong>Future Work</strong></br></br>

Unfortunately, due to time, there were a few things we weren’t able to explore.  One potential idea was to incorporate a finance chart similar to the chore chart. This might help roommates keep track of any shared household purchases.</p>

<p>Additionally, we would have loved to actually implement our idea with new roommates in a household. Focus groups and more validation interviews would also help us to consider more point of views for future iterations.</p>
