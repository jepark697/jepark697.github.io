  <p><strong>Introduction</strong></br></br>
  For a professional website design course, my team of 4 was able to successfully create a website design for a client with an emphasis on mobile-first. This was done over a period of about 10 weeks where we identified our client needs, interviewed customers, made personas, created a mood board, made a prototype, iterated on the prototype, and created a final design which was coded using a heavily modified bootstrap template.
 </p>

    <p><strong>Process</strong></br></br>
      The first step was to talk to our client. We wanted our first conversation to do 3 things. The first was explore what made their business and their products unique. The second was to discuss the kind of mood and functionalities they wanted their website to have. Lastly, we wanted to go through a few websites of other cafes that had similar offerings to discuss what they liked and didn’t like about the websites. This would help them understand what already existed and create a sounding board for us to discuss ideas.

<p>Through this conversation, we realised they wanted to really focus on clean aesthetics. They wanted a simple, modern website that would attract customers and wanted pictures of their products to be the focal point. 
</p>

<p>
However, there was also some negotiation in what we could and couldn’t do as well as suggestions. For example, they originally wanted their website to have a dark brown background and forestry greens. We felt that brighter colors and a white background would work better for their branding of a family-friendly environment. It would also fit more their logo which was in blues and whites. After some conversation, we were able to successfully convince them. 
</p>

  <p>Our next step was to interview 10 customers. This would do 2 things. The first is validate if what the owner thought about the cafe’s branding and appeal was correct. They had assumptions about why customers visited their cafe, but interviewing customers would confirm if they were right. Additionally, it would give us a better idea about what their customers wanted to see and would help us decided the website’s functionality.
        </p>

        <p>After interviewing, we created personas to better empathize with our users. We really wanted to ground our interviews and make sure we were designing for our end users, not just our client. Doing this also allowed us to come up with specific use cases for how each persona would use the website. This helped us to see if all the features our client wanted would be useful to our users. 
        </p>

        <p>From there, we created a summary table which included all the use cases, which personas would use them, and how often the scenario arose. This helped us to prioritize features and make sure the most important ones were designed first. 

        </p>

        <p>Lastly, we created a feature and functionality table to pinpoint what the client and our personas wanted for the website. This really helped us to determine what functionalities we should include and helped ground our designs so they were designed for our users and client.
        </p>

<center><img class="resize" img src="img/21below/Feaure & functionality table.png" alt="feature&fucntionalitytable">

<i>Feature & functionality table</i></center></br></br>

<p>Once we had a good idea about what functionalities and features we wanted to include, we moved onto understanding the competition and branding. We did a thorough competitive analysis of 4 websites with an emphasis on branding, functionality, content, navigation, site architecture, and unique ideas. </p>

        <p>This really helped us understand the different formats that could be used and allowed us to explore features we hadn’t considered. Additionally, it helped us to really comprehend how we were going to effectively brand our client’s website such how to tell their story and display important information. I’ve included the full <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EKuTYlz-VXqs3brloyMcT2rnLLF14bAGxWSrX2zAVe0/edit?usp=sharing">competitive analysis</a>. </p>

        <p>Then we created a mood board to better visualize how we wanted to convey the website’s mood. This helped our client better understand our vision and helped establish trust before we moved onto sketching. 
        </p>

        <center><img class="forty_resize" img src="img/21below/mood board.png" alt="moodboard"></br>

<p>Now it was time to start drawing. Because one of our big goals was to make our design mobile-friendly, we went with a mobile first approach. This helped us to keep our final product usable and minimalistic. In order to do this we sketched examples of how we might want to design the website and discussed placement of buttons, images etc. </p>

<p>There were a lot of tradeoffs involved in our decision-making. For example, we decided to have a pop-up email sign up modal as opposed to something more integrated into the website. Although this may prove to be annoying to users, from a business standpoint, this was something our client emphasized. By having a pop-up modal, more customers were likely to sign up as opposed to a block in the bottom of the screen. Thus, we decided to include the modal. Some sketches I did can be seen below. </p>

<i>Sketches</i></center></br></br>

<p>After doing this, we really wanted to map out how the website would work functionally. As a result, we made a graphic for the site architecture. This would really allow us to hone in on the site hierarchies.</p>

<center><img class="forty_resize" img src="img/21below/site architecture.png" alt="architecture" ></br>
<i>Site architecture graphic</i></center></br></br>


<p>From there, we moved onto wireframing. We created the screens on Figma in order to collaborate. An example of a mobile and desktop screen I created with their analyses can be seen below. 
        </p>

        <center><img class="forty_resize" img src="img/21below/Desktop.png" alt="desktopscreen" style="margin:0px 50px">

<i>Example of desktop screen (left), example of mobile screen (right)</i></center></br></br>

 <p>Then, we created a clickable prototype using InVision for both the <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/5WFYH8EEQDM#/screens/280516634_IPhone_8-2">mobile prototype</a> and <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/5BFYJGJSMFQ#/280536089_Home_2">desktop prototype</a>. We did this so that we could walk through the website with our client. This allowed us to show them all the features and discuss any additional changes. InVision really helped our client imagine how the website would feel and because it wasn’t coded, it allowed us to could make changes very rapidly.</p>

         <p>Now it was time to code. Because we only had about a month to code we decided to use a bootstrap template online and heavily modify it. However, we did run into an issue. The images we received from our client didn’t translate well to the website. Because of this, we scheduled a day to come in and have one of our groupmates use his professional camera to take photos. In the meantime, we used placeholder images when getting feedback from our professor, teaching assistants, and client. </p>

         <p>The feedback we received really helped to strengthen the structure of our website and how to better display information. For example, we decided to change up how we would display the menu and used tabs to create a cleaner interface. We also incorporated all the new imagery and edited all the text on the website to make sure the language matched the branding. An example of screens for desktop and mobile can be seen below.</p>

 <p>Now, the only thing left to do was hand it off to our client. The functional -21°C Snowflake prototype <a href="https://shs416.github.io/21-Below-Site/index.html">website can be found here </a>.
