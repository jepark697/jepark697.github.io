    <h2 class="heading">Receipts Redesign</h2>
  <p><strong>Quick overview:</strong></br>
  For this project, I along with 3 others analyzed the usage of receipts both by customers as well as merchants in order to
  come up with a redesign of the customer copy of receipts. Additionally, the majority of the project was done together. As a
  result, there wasn’t much segregation of tasks. </p>

  <p><strong>Background</strong></br>
    This project stemmed from the idea that receipts are overly long, the text is tiny, and there is a ton of irrelevant
    information. However, we soon realized the the problem ran much deeper than that.</p>

    <p><strong>Problem faced:</strong></br>
      Time was a major issue in this project. We realized that redesigning receipts was too broad of a project, and we had to
       figure out what was a reasonable redesign that could be done in 4 weeks. After some discussion, we wanted to make our
       receipts focused on the customer experience. So, the receipts we wanted to redesign were solely the customer copy.</p>

        <p>However, even though we did limit the scope, we really wanted to make a quality redesign with lots of iterations.
          In order to do this, we had to have a timeline that we followed closely. And, in cases where we were falling behind
           our timeline. We had to reevaluate and eliminate details we wanted to include.
        </p>

    <p> <strong>Process:</strong></br>
      The first step that we took with this project was to create a mindmap of problems we personally had with receipts. From
      there we had a few interviews with users to see what problems they had with receipts. We also analyzed receipts from 13
      different stores to see similarities and differences between them. We charted these out in a graph and did a root problem
      analysis to discover the reason why receipts were so difficult to use. The two major reasons we discovered were bad
      readability and inefficient use of space.</p>

        <p>After identifying these problems, we went into the ideation stage. We came up with two potential redesigns of receipts.
           The first is a revamped version of the original receipts, just with condensed information. The second utilizes a
           hierarchy of information; the information most relevant to the user is at the top, while the information that isn’t
           as relevant is at the bottom. There were tradeoffs to both designs, but ultimately we decided to do some A/B testing
           and see what the public had to say.</p>
          <center><img src="img/Receipts/Round 1.PNG" alt="Prototype 1" ></center></br>

          <p>We did 3 rounds of in-person A/B testing, the majority of which I did. This was done with slight modifications
            to the prototypes during each round. We had a couple major insights during this process. The first was that users
            preferred the solid black line and having the logo of the store at the top. The line helped to distinguish a divide
            in between blocks of information, and users were used to the familiarity of the logo at the top.</p>
            <center><img src="img/Receipts/prototypes 2.PNG" alt="Prototype 2" ></center></br>

            <p>The second thing we realized is that receipts are extremely bad design for those with disabilities.The text is
              too close together, there isn’t enough spacing in between lines, the font is typically in all caps, and shorthand
              is typically used. These things combined make it extremely difficult for those with reading disabilities such as
              Dyslexia or simply those with bad vision to read them.</p>
              <center><img src="img/Receipts/ralphs.PNG" alt="Prototype 3" ></center></br>

              <p>The last thing we learned is that some users may want information that the four of us do not think is needed.
                As a group of 4 relatively “WEIRD” (western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) college students, we
                realized that our views may not reflect the views of others around us. Thus, during our process, we decided to
                target those who were of a different age demographic and of different ethnicities. In the end, there were two
                major changes we had to make to our final design.</p>

                <p>The first change was the addition of the savings after each item. Originally we had thought that it was
                   redundant and a waste of space to put the savings of each item below the item. Thus, we had put a combined
                   total at the bottom. However, we realized there was a good number of customers who liked having this
                   information. As a result, we adjusted our final version to reflect this.</p>

                  <p>The second major change we made was to have the fuel points written on the receipt. We had originally thought
                     about just leaving a link in which customers could digitally find their fuel point information. However,
                     during our interviews, we realized that some users simply preferred having their information on the receipt
                     itself. Thus, we made this modification.</p>
                     <center><img src="img/Receipts/final.PNG" alt="final" ></center></br>

<p> <strong>Future redesign</strong></br>
  There were also a few more things that our group considered, but ultimately did not have time to do. There were 4 features
  we wanted to add. The first was to improve a merchant copy of the receipt. During our interviews with cashiers, we realized
  there is information that businesses would need to know, such as the cash register number, that customers would not.</p>

  <p>Another feature is to include tipping and split the bill. We wanted to figure out a way that would make it so that it is
    easier and faster to calculate tip. In addition, we noticed that customers often use applications such as venmo to split the
    bill. For future redesigns, we wanted to think about the potential to make it easy for customers to split the bill without
    having to resort to using other applications.</p>

    <p>The third feature is a removable top portion that allows the customer to rip off the ticket number in exchange for food.
      We decided that this would be a potential feature simply because some restaurants provide multiple copies of receipts: one
      for the customer to exchange for their food and another to keep for their record. By having a rip-off feature, there would
       be a reduction in the amount of paper and ink used in receipts.</p>

       <p>Lastly, the final feature would be to develop a side application. It would allow users to input a code found on their
          receipts to view them online. The digital version would only have the most important information such as the name of
          the store, the amount paid, a list of items, the date, and the payment method. Other minute details would only be
          displayed if the “show more” button is clicked. This application would especially be useful to users that have lost
          their receipts.</p>
