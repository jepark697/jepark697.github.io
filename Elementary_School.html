    <h2 class="heading">Elementary School Curriculum</h2>
  <p><strong>Quick overview:</strong></br>
  I led multi-disciplinary team of 8 students to create a STEM-based curriculum for fifth grade students
    at an elementary school. This was important to my team because the school was made up of 95% minorities, mostly African
    American and Latino. Due to this, my team wanted to use this project as a way to show these students that careers is STEM
    are fun, and to try to promote more minority representation in the STEM Field. </p>

    <p><strong>Problems faced:</strong></br>
     There were issues with client communication, and visitation. Because our client was a specialized teacher
      who only taught at the school a couple times a month, it was difficult for our team liaison to communicate with her.
      Furthermore, she had other priorities such as working a full-time job and being a mother to a toddler. She didn’t seem to
      respond to emails very frequently, but calling always seemed to be at an inconvenient time. After trial and error, we learned
       that sending a text to let her know we emailed her was the quickest way to communicate with her. However, because of these
       issues, we weren’t able to communicate with her until a week into the project.</p>
 <p>
   The second issue was visitation. The days our client worked at the school seemed to fluctuate quite frequently. Furthermore,
   sometimes she would not know the grades she was teaching until a couple days ahead of time. This was an issue simply because we
   would get late notice that she would be teaching. On one occasion, we even got notice the morning of that she would be teaching.
    We resolved this issue by rapidly communicating within the group, and see if someone could go to visit the school a day or two
    beforehand.</p>

    <p> <strong>Process:</strong></br>
      The first step in this project was to define the problem. In order to do this, everyone on my team conducted 2
      interviews with young students, our stakeholders, or educational professionals. Our team liaison also contacted our client
      and I was able to interview her and some of the students. </p>

      <p>Additionally, she allowed us to sit in on a lesson in which I and one other member of my team were present. By doing
        this, we had a much better idea of what changes we were looking to make. Afterwards, we had a meeting where we created a
        stakeholder analysis to see where each of our stakeholders lied on a chart.</p>
        <center><img src="img/School_pics/Stakeholder.PNG" alt="Stakeholder" ></center></br>

        <p>Then, we made a Gantt Chart of all the things we had to do for this project during the 10 weeks we had to do this
          project. We made this so we could keep track of what we had done, and what we needed to do. As the team lead, I updated
          the project as progressed through the quarter.</p>
          <center><img src="img/School_pics/Gantt Chart.PNG" alt="Gantt" style="width:818px;height:285px;" ></center></br>

          <p>Afterwards, one of the design leads made an empathy map of one of our users, the students. From interviewing them and
            sitting in on a lesson, we discovered what they were looking for in their lessons. Additionally, we started thinking
            about ways we could make the lessons more appealing to them.</p>
            <center><img src="img/School_pics/Empathy Map.PNG" alt="Map" ></center></br>

            <p>The next step was to come up with design requirements. We wanted to make sure that any potential designs fit
              requirements such low-cost, as it was a low-income school. This task was led by the design leads, but finalized
              by the whole team.</p>
              <center><img src="img/School_pics/design requirements.PNG" alt="requirements" style="width:350px;height:387px;">
              </center></br>

              <p>Then, we ideated and came up with 5 ideas. We created storyboards for each one. The one I personally made is
                shown below. Overall, the storyboards are a bit higher quality as they were shown in presentations as well as to our
                client.</p>
                <center><img src="img/School_pics/Egg Parachute Storyboard.jpg" alt="Storyboard" style="width:600px;height:365px;" ></center></br>

                <p>After creating storyboards, we decided to come up with a criteria for evaluating them. This tasks was done by the
                  design leads and cost analysis subteam.</p>
                  <center><img src="img/School_pics/Design Criteria.PNG" alt="Criteria" style="width:380px;height:335px;"></center></br>

                  <p>Then, we created a Pugh Matrix to rate the concepts against each other which was led by the cost analysis
                    subteam. This was done to see overall, which would be the best fit for the final solution.</p>
                    <center><img src="img/School_pics/Pugh Matrix.PNG" alt="Pugh"style="width:404px;height:273px;"  ></center></br>

                    <p>Our final design was called Cartoons to Concepts. It involved having students watch a cartoon to engage
                      them in the lesson, identify a problem,  ideate designs to solve the problem, and building a prototype.
                      We made a total of 8 lessons plans, in which one of the design leads spearheaded, but everyone contributed.
                      We were able to test one of the lesson plans in class and get feedback. This lesson plan was done over the
                      course of two days, and I was present during the second day of the plan. The plan that was tested can be
                      seen below.</p>
                      <center><img src="img/School_pics/Lesson Plan 1.PNG" alt="Plan 1" ></center>
                      <center><img src="img/School_pics/lesson plan 2.PNG" alt="Plan 2" ></center>
                      <center><img src="img/School_pics/lesson plan 3.PNG" alt="Plan 3" ></center>
                    </br>

                      <p>Overall, we got very positive feedback from both our client as well as the students. One change we
                        decided was to make the lesson plan more flexible for when students are absent the first day. The second
                        change we made was to spread each lesson plan out over a longer period of time. This was because some
                        students worked slower than others, and it took longer than expected to set up. One student’s work can
                        be seen below.</p>
                        <center><img src="img/School_pics/Example 1.PNG" alt="Ex 1">
                          <img src="img/School_pics/example.PNG" alt="Ex 2" style="width:379px;height:285px;" ></center>
                            </br>
                        <p>Ultimately, we had 3 presentations each one taking about 10 minutes which was primarily created by
                          the 2 presentation managers. Additionally, we all contributed to a 51 page final report.</p>
