    <h2 class="heading">A New Tool for Robotics Design</h2>
  <p><strong>Quick overview:</strong></br>
  I am a co-lead on a project which explores the creation and usage of a new tool using Contextual and Participatory Design. The project started back in July where I worked full-time, and is still continuing. My partner and I hope to be co-first authors for the paper that we are writing about this research. We plan on submitting our paper soon to the journal ACM transactions on Human-Robot Interaction.</p> 

<p>I will note that as our work has not been accepted yet, I cannot go into detail on the work itself. I will merely explain the process of how the work was done sans pictures.
 </p>

 <p><strong>Background:</strong></br>
     Participatory Design is a type of design in which designers create products with their end users. This type of design is useful because it helps to understand the user’s wants and needs. Contextual design is a type of design where one designs in the context of where the design would ideally be used. This design is useful because it considers the environment. As a result, the final product is better design for life, rather than in a bubble.
</p>
<p>In terms of research, I work in a lab that primarily focuses on healthcare robotics. As a result, my partner and I wanted to design a tool that could both be used by our end user, older adults, but flexible enough so that it could be modified and applied to different groups
</p>
<p>Lastly, before the project began, my partner had previously done research with Older Adults for another project. We used some of the findings from this project to supplement the research done in the first stage of the project.
</p>
    <p><strong>Problems faced:</strong></br>
     There were 3 major problems that I had during this project. The first problem was that a postdoctoral researcher was supposed to lead this project. My co-lead and I were originally going to to be working on the project under her. Unfortunately, due to logistical issues she was not able to arrive in San Diego until later August. Because of this, my partner and I had to rapidly adapt the the lead roles.
</p>
 <p>
   The second issue was visitation. The days our client worked at the school seemed to fluctuate quite frequently. Furthermore,
   sometimes she would not know the grades she was teaching until a couple days ahead of time. This was an issue simply because we
   would get late notice that she would be teaching. On one occasion, we even got notice the morning of that she would be teaching.
    We resolved this issue by rapidly communicating within the group, and see if someone could go to visit the school a day or two
    beforehand.</p>
    <p>
   This leads to the last issue which was my co-lead being absent for a week. Originally, we had planned on conducting usability testing together. However, due to the amount of depth the work had, we were running behind schedule. Thus, I had to create the materials and conduct the two usability testing sessions on my own.
</p>

    <p> <strong>Process:</strong></br>
     My partner and I completed a lot of research on related subject matter. For example, I analyzed articles on older adults and the types of challenges they face as they age. Additionally, I analyzed articles on how to design effectively for older adults, participatory design methods, conducting experiments, and a plethora of robotics-related works. By doing this, I had a better idea of the type of tool we wanted to create. 
 </p>

      <p>After completing research on related subjects, my partner and I created an affinity diagram. We wanted to map out the different components we were considering for our tool. From there, we started to notice themes and decided to conduct a usability session to test out the mechanics of our tool. 
</p>
    

        <p>As my partner was absent during this week. This section was done alone. I created two low-fidelity prototypes and had 2 groups test out the different versions. This involved creating a script of both experiments, making surveys, and finding video equipment so my partner could see the experiments when she returned.
</p>

          <p>Afterwards, one of the design leads made an empathy map of one of our users, the students. From interviewing them and
            sitting in on a lesson, we discovered what they were looking for in their lessons. Additionally, we started thinking
            about ways we could make the lessons more appealing to them.</p>

            <p>After this, two more affinity diagrams were created. One diagram mapped out the issues that occurred during the game. The other diagram contained potential solutions for each of the problems that occured. From this, there were a few more iterations that were tested between my co-lead and I. This led to the final version of the tool that my partner and I physically constructed ourselves.</p>

              <p>For our final version, we started with a pilot group. We decided to have a pilot group for two reasons. Firstly, we wanted to make sure there wouldn’t be any logistical issues for our final users. Secondly, we wanted to see if the interaction between participants was the type of interaction we wanted. If not, we wanted to explore ways we would curate the interactions we wanted to see.</p>

                <p>After we had this session, we decided to make a few subtle changes to our tool. From there we had two groups in which we did a comparative study, one of which was older adults. Given that the amount of participants were small, we simply wanted to see if there was a significant difference between the groups. Furthermore, we wanted to see if there were themes that we found within both groups. Ultimately, we wanted to evaluate if this tool could be used for Robotics Design.</p>
               <p> <strong>Future plans</strong></br>
Currently, I’m still working on finishing the paper, and getting that submitted. If the paper is accepted, I will update this project with more specific details and a link or citation to my work.
