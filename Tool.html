    <h2 class="heading">A New Tool for Robotics Design</h2>
  <p><strong>Introduction</strong></br></br>
  I was the co-lead on a project which explored the creation and usage of a new tool using Contextual and Participatory Design. 
      Because the research paper on this project has not yet been released, I can't go into too much detail regarding the results or include any pictures.
      However, I will explain my process.</p> 
 
 <p>
     In order to better understand what I did, I want to give a bit of context. Participatory Design is a type of design in which designers create products with their end users, similar to co-design. This type of design is useful because it helps to really understand the user’s wants and needs. On the other hand, Contextual Design is a type of design where one designs in the context of where the design would ideally be used. This type of design really helps the end product be designed for the context and environment it is to be used. As a result, by utliizing these types of design, the final product is designed for life, rather than in a bubble.
</p>
<p>In terms of research, I worked in a lab that primarily focuses on healthcare robotics. As a result, my partner and I wanted to design a tool that could both be used by our end user, older adults, but flexible enough so that it could be modified and applied to different groups
</p>
<p>Lastly, before the project began, my partner had previously done research with Older Adults for another project. We used some of the findings from this project to supplement the research done in the first stage of the project.
</p>
    <p><strong>Problems faced</strong></br></br>
     There were 3 major problems that I faced during this project. The first problem was that a postdoctoral researcher was originally supposed to lead this project. My co-lead and I were meant to simply support her. Unfortunately, due to logistical issues she was not able to arrive in San Diego until later August. Because of this, my partner and I had to rapidly adapt to the lead roles.
</p>
 <p>
   The second issue was time. We realized that once school started, we would have difficulty finding time to work together. Thus, we aimed to finish the project during the Summer and finish the writing during the school year. However, because of this, there was a lot of work to be done within 2 ½ months.</p>
    <p>
   This leads to the last issue which was my co-lead being absent for a week. Originally, we had planned on conducting usability testing together. However, due to the amount of depth the work had, we were running behind schedule. Thus, I had to create the materials and conduct two usability testing sessions on my own with my co-lead occasionally helping remotely from London, England.
</p>

    <p> <strong>Process</strong></br></br>
     Before starting our design, my partner and I researched heavily on related subject matter. The goal of this was to get better context into what has already been created, what challenges older adults face, and how to create a tool that helps to support this type of design. For example, I analyzed articles on older adults and the types of challenges they face as they age. Additionally, I read literature on designing effectively for older adults, participatory design methods, conducting experiments, and a plethora of robotics-related works. 
 </p>

      <p>After completing research on related subjects, my partner and I created an affinity diagram. We wanted to map out the different components we were considering for our tool. From there, we started to notice themes and decided to conduct a usability session to test out the mechanics of our tool. 
</p>
    

        <p>As my partner was absent during this week. This section was done alone. I created two low-fidelity prototypes and organized 2 groups to test out the different versions. This involved creating a script of both experiments, making surveys, and finding video equipment so my partner could see the experiments when she returned.
</p>
            <p>After this, two more affinity diagrams were created. One diagram mapped out what happened during each prototype and the key insights from each one. The goal of this diagram was to help us organize what we learned and better understand the problems that occured. The other diagram was made afterwards. In this diagram, we ideated potential solutions to problems and edits we could make to the protoypes. From this, there were a few more iterations that were tested between my co-lead and I. This led to the final version of the tool that my partner and I physically constructed ourselves.</p>

              <p>For our final version, we started with a pilot group. We decided to have a pilot group for two reasons. Firstly, we wanted to make sure there wouldn’t be any logistical issues for our final users. Secondly, we wanted to see if the interaction between participants was the type of interaction we wanted. If not, we wanted to explore ways we would curate the interactions we wanted to see.</p>

                <p>After we had this session, we decided to make a few subtle changes to our tool. From there we held a comparative study with two key groups, Roboticists and Older Adults. Given that we only had 2 participants for each session, we simply wanted to see if there was a significant difference in the designs created between the groups. Furthermore, we wanted to see if there were any themes that we found within both groups. Ultimately, our goal was to evaluate if this tool could be used for Robotics Design.</p>
<p> The results were fairly positive. However, I ended up leaving my position before any of the writing was published. Thus, if my co-lead publishes a paper on our research, I'll update the entry with pictures of our work and a link to the article.
